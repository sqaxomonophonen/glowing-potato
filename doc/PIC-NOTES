Due to Java/AWT problem in combination with dwm I need to start MPLAB tools
with _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1

_JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1 mplab_ide
_JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1 mplab_ipe



mplab_ide setup:
 - new project, "Standalone Project"
 - device: PIC16F15313
 - don't select a tool
 - select xc8 compiler
 - pick any name
 - add main.c
 - then symlink .c file from here to project main.c



mplab_ipe setup:
 - Device: PIC16F15313
 - Power / VDD = 4.75V (5V might work)
 - [x] Power Target circuit from Tool
 - [x] Use High Voltage Program mode entry
